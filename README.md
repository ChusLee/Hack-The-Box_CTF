Welcome to my **Hack The Box Labs Writeups** repository!

This repository contains detailed walkthroughs of the HTB machines and challenges that I have successfully compromised. Each writeup documents the exact steps I followed during the process, including enumeration, exploitation, and post‑exploitation.

## 📘 What You Will Find Here

Each writeup includes:

- **Step-by-step explanations** of my methodology

- **Screenshots and terminal captures**  
- **Notes and observations** that helped in gaining initial access or escalating privileges  
- **Lessons learned** and tips applicable to similar scenarios

All content is based on my personal experience while solving HTB labs.
